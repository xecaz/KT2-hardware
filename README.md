#KT-2 the shitty robot that noone knew the hardware of, being reversed engineered.

These are my findings after about a week of painstakingly tracking pins from the ESP32S3-WROOM1 to motor-controllers, to servos and their feedback pots going back to the
ESP. If you don't know what you are doing, be prepared to turn your robot into a paperweight. Triggering one pin wrong can break it beyond repair. You have been warned.
