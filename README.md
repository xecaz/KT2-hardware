#KT-2 the shitty robot that noone knew the hardware of, being reversed engineered.

These are my findings after about a week of painstakingly tracking pins from the ESP32S3-WROOM1 to motor-controllers, 
to servos and their feedback pots going back to the ESP. If you don't know what you are doing, be prepared to turn 
your robot into a paperweight. Triggering one pin wrong can break it beyond repair. You have been warned.

#I can't emphasis enough that using this code, or modifying it is on YOUR OWN RISK, i take no responsability for damage your hardware.

With that out of the way..
